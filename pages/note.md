# JSON
- JSON is not exact the same as js object
- JSON is inspired by js notation
- JSON is subset of js obj notation
- anything valid in JSON is js but not the other way around
### JSON vs js
```javascript
// fine in only js
var objectLiteral = 
{ 
    firstname: "Mary",
    isProgrammer: true
}
// fine in JSON AND JS
{
  "firstname": "firstname",
  "isProgrammer": true
}

```
